# BM-MK-2
An updated version of Bookmark Manager with a whole new framework. Available on the chrome web store

This folder contains the contents that are installed when you download the chrome extension "BM Bookmark Manager"

The main files in this application are "main.js", "tagManager.js" and "options.js"

"main.js" contains the code that displays the main page when a new tab is opened. The code takes the stored data from chrome's
api about the bookmarks that the user has and displays this. The code also allows for most of the features to operate.

"tagManager.js" controls the page that manages tags. It produces a grid layout that allows users to change which bookmarks have 
certain tags.

"options.js" controls the options page and is the brains behind the changing of colour scheme and others.
